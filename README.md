# EmojiGenerator
Generate simple and colorful emojis from any SVG file, primarily suitable for Discord emojis.
---
I've been working on a program to automatically generate various emojis and icons, primarily for use on Discord, and I've decided to make it open-source and upload it for free use.

Please respect the ownership of the code and don't release it as your own.

Here are a few examples of what you can do with the program. The icons are from FontAwesome:

If you want to compile the program yourself, install Python (>3.9), MinGW-w64 and the GTK3 toolkit.
Then you can clone the program from GitHub, edit it if you wish, and run the `build.sh` script.

If you want to contribute to the project, feel free to open a pull request.
